            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I have been learning coding and computer skills since I was in middle school.  I continued my computer education in highschool through a focused pathway.  This put me in a position to excel when I finaly made it to The University of North Carolina.  
                I have compleaded many projects at UNCC and I have learned a lot, but now it is time for me to graduate.
                I am excited to put my knowlege and skills to the test.  I feel that I have grown as much as I can from my time at UNCC but I need to move on to get to the next stage of my evolution.
