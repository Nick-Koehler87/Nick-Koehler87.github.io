        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
Computer Science has deep roots in my life.  Growing up in the 21st century, technology has played a central role in my life,
 and I have developed a natural skill in using it.  I have a deep fascination with computers that goes back to playing video games in my
youth.  I spent much of my free time in middle school teaching myself how to code using online resources purely of my own ambition.  
I had a dream of developing code and software and creating novel systems.  From this, I have developed a drive to learn more and build 
my skills, and that drive is still strong today.  Having continued this passion through a tailored path offered by my high school, and 
now as a graduating with a degree in computer science, I am finally ready to put my skills to good use in the field.  I am searching 
for an entry-level software engineer role.  The reason you should hire me is because I have more experience than most people my age.  
I will come into your company stronger than other people, and as a young person, I still have a lot of potential to grow.  
<br><br>
Beyond having a large amount of knowledge for my age, I have lots of experience working at a variety of different places. 
My most recent work experience was as a data manager.  I was employed by my father's law firm to organize the data of cases, 
digitize them, and destroy old cases.  From this experience, I developed my organizational skills. I also gained experience 
of working in an office setting.  Going back I have experience working in a kitchen.  From this, I developed my ability to work 
hard in high-pressure environments.  I also developed my work ethic, able to tackle tasks that others would find undesirable.  
I am the kind of person who can do what it takes to make sure a project gets done.  My first ever work experience was at a summer camp. 
 This experience taught me about responsibility, as I was held accountable for the safety and well-being of up to 20 children at once. 
  The consequences of messing up this job were real and required me to do my best to ensure the safety of the children.  
  This job also required me to constantly adapt to the needs of the clients (children).  This developed my ability to fill any role 
  needed in the moment.   Overall my experience working has given me ambitions to do work that challenges me. I am hungry to prove
   myself and I am always looking for opportunities to develop my personal and professional skills further. 
   <br><br>
            If you take me on to your team, not only will you have someone who is dedicated, knowledgeable, and friendly, but you
             have someone who will grow over time to enrich your company and lead those around me to do the best work possible.</p>
