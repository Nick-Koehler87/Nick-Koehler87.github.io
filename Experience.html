            <br><br>
            <h2>Professional</h2>
<p>
    I have worn many hats though I have only recently graduated from university. I have worked as an administrative intern, landscaper, camp counselor, construction worker, and delivery driver; I have helped older folk clean out their overstuffed garage and worked in kitchens. I have worked physically and mentally demanding jobs and I have worked boring jobs. This has strengthened my character and given me adaptability and grit.  These experiences have shaped me and I have learned from them just as I have learned from my education. My education qualifies me, but my diverse professional experiences make me proactive and quick to learn procedures with minimal supervision.  Most importantly I am not afraid to take responsibility for my work.
    <br><br>
    These experiences have given me skills as well as character.  My work as an administrative intern at my father's law firm and as a mentee to Ms. Simon at US Renal Care has given me experience working with data entry, working with Tableau, and Excel as well as other Microsoft Office tools. I took the oportunity to improved my written communication skills, as well as punctuality.  I occasionally gave presentations which honed my communication skills and ability to convey complex information effectively. Overall, my professional experience has given me more capacity for responsibility, made me a well-rounded person, and it has left me with important professional skills.

<h2>College</h2>
<p>
I graduated from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte in May 2024. My time at UNCC was transformative. Not only did I gain a broad and deep education in computers and technology, but I also underwent a personal change. I began pursuing a degree in 2020, and lockdowns changed everything about that experience. I struggled during this time to maintain myself and to engage with my studies, however, each year I improved. I first got on the dean's list in the second semester of junior year and maintained that throughout my senior year, finishing my last semester with a 4.0 GPA for the semester. I have learned to take pride in my work, rather than reject it. More than anything else, this change in attitude has made me a more whole person.
<br><br>
As far as the relevant skills I gained, my degree in computer science covered all the major topics, and my concentration in AI brought me deep into the field of data science and programming. Combined with my pre-university education, I have experience with a wide variety of software and programming languages, including all industry-standard languages such as SQL, SAS, Python, C, and R, as well as libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
<br><br>
When I first came to Charlotte, I was more focused on software engineering. However, over the last few years, I have come to realize that data science and analytics are my true calling. As part of my concentration in AI, I got to work on machine learning algorithms and relational database systems. I was immersed in mathematics as well as technology, covering linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. All of these systems interacting seems to be the most useful place of development for society. We make many assumptions as humans without realizing how limited our experience is, and data science is one way we can dispel many harmful myths and reduce our negative impact on the world, both socially and physically.

<h2>Secondary Education</h2>
<p>
My interest in technology was self-motivated. I started studying technology and software on my own in middle school, using online resources, and quickly discovered that I had a natural aptitude for it. I began with Java programming, and this passion led me to pursue a software-focused program in high school. This program was mainly focused on software development, with some introductions to hardware, and it gave me a strong foundation that would help me thrive in college. These foundational experiences have given me an intuitive understanding of how technology works and have helped me to understand software on a deeper level.
