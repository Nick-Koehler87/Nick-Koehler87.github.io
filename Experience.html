            <p style="padding: 1.5%;">I am a well-rounded individual with strong communication and technology skills. I have experience working with data entry and have been educated in software engineering and data analysis.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>College</h2> <p>
I graduated from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte in May 2024.  My time at UNCC was transformative.  Not only did I gain a broad and deep education in computers and technology, but I also underwent a personal change.  I began pursuing a degree in 2020, and lockdowns changed everything about that experience.  I struggled during this time to maintain myself and to engage with my studies, however, each year I improved.  I first got on the dean's list in the second semester of junior year and maintained that throughout my senior year, finishing my last semester with a 4.0 GPA for the semester.  I have learned to take pride in my work, rather than reject it.  More than anything else, this change in attitude has made me a more whole person
<br>
As far as the relevant skills I gained, my degree in computer science covered all the major topics, and my concentration in AI brought me deep into the field of data science.  Combined with my pre-university education, I have experience with a wide variety of software and programming languages, including all industry-standard languages such as Python, C, and R.
