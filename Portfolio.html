            <p>Posted: 8/8/2024 <br> This presentation was enjoyable to make. I ended up actually learning about the topic which is wonderful. This project helped me brush up on many different skills. I used SQL to create different views to see the data in different ways. I also had to really work on my communication skills. I did many different takes and had to be very careful. I presented a lot of information densely and that came with challenges.</p>

            <p>This project was created for my 2023 Advanced Game Develompent course.  The assignment was to create a 3d game prototype in unity. 
               As with any project, I learned a lot from this and there is a list of things that I would do differently if I created it today.

            <p>I am very proud of this project because I did it for a Game Jam! I made all of the code while I had a partner create the art.
               The entire game from conception to compleation was created within a week and I think that is awesome. Its hard to compleat a project, but we managed to do it in a very reasonable amout of time.
