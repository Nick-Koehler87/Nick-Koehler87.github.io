                <p>I am extremely pleased to present my latest project. I have developed a machine learning algorithm that can successfully predict forest fires given meteorological data. After my last project, the Environmental Report, I felt the urge to make something that could make use of the data. After looking around I came across the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and this data set spoke to me. I used techniques I learned at UNCC to develop this algorithm. It uses a least squares linear regression to predict how many acres will be burned by fire on a particular day. I plan to upgrade this algorithm by adding a classification step that will determine if there is a fire and then feed it into a regression that will determine the size of the fire.

                <p>The creation of this report was satisfying and refreshing as I haven't done many research projects since I was still doing non-computer sciences at school.  This report dives into the data, the historical situation of climate change, and predicts how things will play out in the future.  I talk about where our energy comes from currently, where the emissions are coming from, and how the political situation affects this.  I have just scratched the surface with this report, and if time is forgiving, it deserves a part two!

                ScheduMingle was completed by myself and 4 classmates in my senior year at UNCC. The purpose of the project was to follow Agile methodology to deliver a high-quality final product. This particular video was created to present the results of the final sprint. We used industry-standard practices like user stories to break the project into specific features and identified blockers early in the process. I was responsible for the account creation feature, as well as acting as a sort of project manager. For the account creation feature, I used Amazon RDS and MySQL to store, authenticate, and manage the data, as well as HTML code to create the account creation form. As a project manager, I was responsible for making design documents, user stories, and presenting our product each sprint. I gained valuable insights into the full software engineering process, including team collaboration, project management, and documentation.</p>
